  Nugget Doom's NUGHUD guide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The NUGHUD lump is a variant of MBF's OPTIONS lump, used specifically by Nugget
Doom to customize the Crispy/Minimalistic HUD. As implied, it uses the same
format as the OPTIONS lump, and can only be loaded from WADs.
Excerpt from mbfedit.txt:

"The OPTIONS lump has the same format as mbf.cfg: A text file listing option
names and values, optionally separated by blank or comment lines."


In practice, there are two types of elements in the NUGHUD. Both types use the
following variables for each item:

- An integer for X position. Can be any number between -1 and 320 (inclusive).
  A value of -1 will disable the widget.

- An integer for Y position. Can be any number between 0 and 200 (inclusive).

- An integer to apply a widescreen delta when using the widescreen Crispy HUD.
  Can be any number between -1 and 1 (inclusive).
  As implied, it is only relevant when on widescreen. A value of -1 will shift
  the widget left, a value of 1 will shift it right, and a value of 0 won't
  shift it at all.

Now, each type of element of specifically:

First, we have widgets (like the Health count). These mostly just use the
variables listed above, but there are some exceptions:

- There's an integer to toggle the face background, whose position is linked to
  that of the face.

- There's another integer to have the Time widget be relocated to the position
  of the STS widget, in case the latter is inactive.

On the other hand, we have patches. These are graphics that can be drawn
anywhere on the screen, behind the widgets. They use an additional string
variable that determines the name of the patch to be used, which can be a sprite
(i.e. a lump between S_ markers, like "MEDIA0") or a graphic (like "STBAR").
Note that custom lumps CAN be used (for example, a graphic called "NEWPATCH").
The name used in the NUGHUD lump MUST be enclosed between quotation marks.


By default and compared to the original Crispy HUD, the NUGHUD hides the face
widget and shows 8 weapon numbers in the Arms display instead of 6.

As an example of the format, loading a WAD with a NUGHUD lump with the following
contents (text within the quotation marks, NOT including the quotation marks)
will restore the face widget:
