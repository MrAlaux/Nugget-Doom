﻿# Nugget Doom

Nugget Doom (formerly known as IRamm, originally a [Crispy Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Crispy_Doom) fork) is a fork of [Woof!](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof), simply intended to implement additional features.

### DISCLAIMER
Although the new code has been written with the intention of not breaking demo compatibility, it has not been properly tested yet.
**RECORD DEMOS AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

## Features

Most of Nugget Doom's features come from other sources, like source ports and mods; the initial implementations for some are **ported from (p.f.)** said sources, while others are just **inspired by (i.b.)** them. These acknowledgements are included in the feature lists below; be aware that some might be inaccurate or outright missing.

A few settings are labeled as _**CFG-Only**_: they can only be toggled by editing `nugget-doom.cfg`. For these settings, their config variable names are provided alongside the _CFG-Only_ label as guidance.

# Releases

Source code and Windows binaries (MSVC builds for Windows 7 and newer) for the latest release can be found on the [Release](https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom/releases/latest) page.

The most recent list of changes can be found in the [Changelog](https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

A complete history of changes and releases can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom/releases) page.

## Versioning

Nugget Doom follows a fairly simple (albeit arbitrary) **X.Y.Z** versioning system:

- **X** is increased in the event of at least one major implementation, such as a new spec like _UMAPINFO_;
- **Y** is increased in the event of at least one minor implementation, such as a new cheat;
- **Z** is increased in the event of at least one bug fix, text/code reformatting, or merging of _Woof!_ updates, even if the changes to the latter are considered minor or major.

Incrementing any of the first values will reset the latter (i.e. a major change to 1.1.2 would shift it to 2.0.0).

# Compiling

As a Woof! fork, its build instructions should also apply here:

The Nugget Doom source code is available at GitHub: <https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom>.

## Linux, and Windows with MSYS2

The following libraries need to be installed:

 * [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2) (>= 2.0.18)
 * [SDL2_net](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net)
 * [openal-soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft)
 * [libsndfile](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile) (>= 1.1.0 for MPEG support)
 * [fluidsynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth) (>= 2.2.0, optional)
 * [libxmp](https://github.com/libxmp/libxmp) (optional)
 
Usually your distribution should have the corresponding packages in its repositories, and if your distribution has "dev" versions of those libraries, those are the ones you'll need.

Once installed, compilation should be as simple as:

```
 cd nugget-doom
 mkdir build; cd build
 cmake ..
 make
```

After successful compilation the resulting binary can be found in the `src/` directory.

## Windows with Visual Studio

Visual Studio 2019 and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) comes with built-in support for CMake by opening the source tree as a folder.

Install vcpkg <https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows>. Integrate it into CMake or use toolchain file:
```
 cd nugget-doom
 cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
 cmake --build build
```
CMake will automatically download and build all dependencies for you.
