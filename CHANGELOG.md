## New Features

- **_Freecam_**
- **_'BABYMODE'_ cheat**, to toggle ITYTD benefits

## Changes

- **Improved drawing of NUGHUD Face background**:
  - In singleplayer, the background from the Status Bar itself is now used
    instead of a multiplayer Face background
  - The vertical position of the background is now dependent on the height
    of the multiplayer Face backgrounds
- **Changed _"Fancy Teleport [to Pointer]"_ to _"Fancy Warping"_**

## Bug Fixes

- **Crosshair not being drawn if the chasecam mode were set** even if the chasecam itself were disabled
