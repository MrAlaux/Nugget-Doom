## Changes

- **Merged changes from the following Woof! releases:**
  - [**12.0.1**](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof/releases/tag/woof_12.0.1);
  - [**12.0.2**](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof/releases/tag/woof_12.0.2).
- **NUGHUD:**
  - Let Ammo, Health and Armor icons fall back to vanilla sprites;
  - Made Patches and icons alignable horizontally and vertically;
  - Disabled Armor icon by default;
  - Changed `weapheight` range from [0, 200] to [-32, 32].
  - Inverted effect of `weapheight` (greater values now shift the sprites downwards)ยน for consistency with other properties;
  - Changed `secret_y` default to 84, to match Woof!.
- **Speed of non-Melt wipes is now independent of resolution**
- **Implemented Teleporter Zoom for multiplayer respawning**
- **_Blink [Automap] Marks_ message now includes number of marks**
- **Applied interpolation for Chasecam speed effect**
- **MDK Fist attacks now prioritize enemies over friends**
- **Current resolution is now reported by some video-related menu items**
- **Disabled `input_spy` and `input_menu_reloadlevel` when typing in Chat**

**1\.** This change will affect existing NUGHUDs. Negating the value of `weapheight` will restore the intended effect.
